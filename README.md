# Heart_disease_prediction
This project is focused on predicting heart disease using a dataset containing patient health metrics. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and applying various machine learning models to classify whether a patient has heart disease.

Key highlights of the project:

Dataset Analysis: Extracted insights such as correlations, class distributions, and feature descriptions.
Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Linear SVM achieved accuracies of 85.25%, 85.25%, and 81.97%, respectively.
Decision Tree and Random Forest provided competitive accuracies, with Random Forest reaching a 90.16% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning.
XGBoost achieved 83.61% accuracy, showcasing robust performance.
A neural network model was implemented using Keras, demonstrating the use of deep learning in binary classification tasks.
Tools and Technologies: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, XGBoost, and TensorFlow/Keras.
